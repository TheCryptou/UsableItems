# 🪄 UsableItem

**UsableItem** is a lightweight and flexible **Paper/Bukkit 1.21.8** plugin for **Minecraft Java Edition**.  
It allows server operators to easily assign one or multiple commands to any in-game item.  
When a player right-clicks while holding a configured item, the commands are executed automatically based on defined permissions and tags.

## ✨ Features

- Assign custom commands to any Minecraft item  
- Supports multiple commands per item  
- Permission and tag-based control system  
- JSON-based configuration (easy to edit and expand)  
- Lightweight, fast, and fully written in **English**  
- Works out of the box — no external dependencies

## 📁 Configuration

After first launch, the plugin automatically creates the following folder:
```

plugins/UsableItem config/

```

Inside it, you’ll find:
- `usableitem.json` → your main configuration file  
- `example.json` → an example file for reference only (not used in-game)

## 🧠 Usage

1. Hold any item in your hand.  
2. Run the command:
/usableitem

3. A new configuration entry is automatically added to `usableitem.json`.  
4. Edit the file to define the commands, tags, and permissions you want.  
5. Reload or restart your server — and that’s it.
